# Description

This project is a *Go language* learning project with simple RestFul services. It uses postgres db inside with docker-compose. You can compose with dockerfile or create your own postgres database without it. 

For run docker-compose, you need to write following commands. In your project folder,

```
      cd docker
      docker-compose up
```

then PostgreSQL works on 32300 Port (32300 -> 5432). You can access with database IDE (DataGrip, Intellij etc.) with configure port 32300.

If you want to conncect from your host system type the following command to terminal.
```
      psql -h localhost -p 32300 -d docker -U docker --password
```

# Database table configuration
```
      CREATE TABLE USERS (
        ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        NAME TEXT NOT NULL,
        SURNAME TEXT NOT NULL,
        AGE INT NOT NULL
      );
      
      CREATE SEQUENCE public.users_id_seq NO MINVALUE NO MAXVALUE NO CYCLE;
      ALTER TABLE public.users ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('public.users_id_seq');
      ALTER SEQUENCE public.users_id_seq OWNED BY public.users.id;
```

# Database access configuration inside code 
Under config/config.go directory in the project, you will find database access configuration. You can change it with your custom configuration.
```
      DB_USER     = "docker"
      DB_PASSWORD = "docker"
      DB_NAME     = "docker"
      PORT = "32770"
```
# How can run?

First of all, you need to have *Go* in your computer. For Mac you can install with brew easily.

```
      brew install go
```

If everything is OK, you should encounter an output like this at terminal when wrote *go version*.

```
      go version                                    
      go version go1.9.2 darwin/amd64
```
You need to following library for the postgres.
```
      go get github.com/lib/pq
```
For run the project, in the project directory you need to write following command.

```
      go run main.go
```

If everything works correctly, you can start the CRUD operations with following URL.

```
      http://127.0.0.1:3000
```
