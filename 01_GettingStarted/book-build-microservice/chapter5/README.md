# Chapter 4  
This chapter will help you understand about some patterns in Microservice? 
- It will help you get a overview about Microservice.
- Help you from basic design to the actual design in the reality.
- Beside that, we need to imagine your design patterns in Microservice to the real world, and thinking about how can it solve the problem?

# Introduction
I am not talking about software design patterns like factories or facades, but architectural designs like load balancing and service discovery.
