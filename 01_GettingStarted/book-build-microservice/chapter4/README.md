# Chapter 4  
This chapter will help you understand that how can you test something such as Backend API?  

# Introduction
When you try to define what testing is, you will come up with a multitude of answers, and many of us will not understand the 
full benefits of testing until we've been burnt by buggy software or we have tried to change a complex code base which has no tests.
```
"The art of a good night's sleep is knowing you will not get woken by a support call and the piece of mind from being able to
confidently change your software in an always moving market."
=> Nghĩa là:
"Nghệ thuật của một giấc ngủ ngon là biết rằng bạn sẽ không bị đánh thức bởi một cuộc gọi hỗ trợ và phần tâm trí không thể
tự tin thay đổi phần mềm của bạn trong một thị trường luôn chuyển động." 
```
OK, so I am trying to be funny, but the concept is correct:  
- Nobody enjoys debugging poorly written code, and indeed, 
- Nobody enjoys the stress caused when a system fails. 
- Starting out with a mantra of quality first can alleviate many of these problems.
